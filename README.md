<h2> <b> West Bromwich Albion 5 - 2 Chelsea - Where are they now? </b> </h2>
<br>
<p> <i> On this day 5 years ago, Premier League West Brom had perhaps their most famous moment, in a season that ultimately ended in relegation. Up against Thomas Tuchel's Chelsea side who would go on to win the Champions League, Sam Allardyce's baggies overcame the odds to take all three points and stun the blues with 5 goals in a thrilling match at Stamford Bridge. In this article, we will be detailing where each of the players involved are now, and how their careers have developed since that afternoon in London. </i> </p>
<br>
<h4> <b> Sam Johnstone (GK) </b> </h4>
<br>
<p> West Brom goalkeeper on the afternoon, the former Manchester United academy graduate may have conceded 2 goals, yet we doubt would have been too dissapointed come the full time whistle. Johnstone went on to play a backup role at Crystal Palace, before making the switch to bitter rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers, where he continues to battle for minutes with long time 'keeper Jose Sá. Now 32, Johnstone will be hoping to secure more consistent minutes to propel himself back into contention for the England National team. </p>

<br>
<h4> <b> Darnell Furlong </b> </h4>
<br>
<p> The QPR academy graduate spent 6 years with the Baggies, totalling 238 appearances before leaving in August 2025 for Ipswich Town for a reported £4m. Since joining the Tractor Boys, Furlong has managed (____) appearances and has been a solid performer at right back for Kieran McKenna. </p>
<br>
<h4> <b> Dara O'Shea </b> </h4>
<br>
<p> Former Albion captain Dara O’Shea was on the right of three centre-backs in Allardyce’s starting 11, but was forced off after 24 minutes with an injury. The Irish international left West Brom in 2023 for newly promoted Burnley, but once again was unable to keep them in the Premier League as they slumped to a 19th placed finish under Vincent Kompany. O’Shea continued his Premier League career by signing immediately for Ipswich Town, where he suffered a second successive relegation. He remains at Ipswich Town, where he is the captain and has featured in (___) games this season. </p>

<br>
<h4> <b> Semi Ajayi </b> </h4>
<br>
<p> Another who left West Brom in recent memory, Semi Ajayi featured at the centre of defense for West Brom on the day. The towering Nigerian spent 6 years with the Baggies, racking up 170 appearances before completing a free transfer to Hull City last August. Ajayi also made it to the semi-finals at AFCON 2025 with Nigeria, a competition in which he started all but one of their matches and even scored their opening goal of the tournament against Tanzania. Now aged 32, Ajayi will be remembered as a tall, strong, quick centreback who aside from the occasional mistakes or injuries, was a solid performer. </p>
<br>
<h4> <b> Kyle Bartley (C) </b> </h4>
<br>
<p> Former captain Kyle Bartley was the third centre back picked. Bartley spent 7 years with the baggies, making over 200 appearances before a knee injury put an end to his career in 2025, revealing that he needed knee replacement surgery as he was “left with no ligament in his knee”. Though divisive at times, Bartley will be remembered as a former captain and long time servant of the club who had some truly exceptional campaigns. Nowadays, Bartley can often be heard on BBC West Midlands Radio offering his expert opinion on football. </p>
<br>
<h4> <b> Connor Townsend </b> </h4> 
<br>
<p> Rotated with Kieron Gibbs through the 20/21 Premier League season, former Baggies left back and stand-in captain Conor Townsend completed the backline. After 195 league appearances for West Brom, and well over 200 in all competitions, Townsend left for Ipswich where he remains teammates with Dara O’Shea. Since joining Ipswich, Townsend has struggled for consistent minutes behind first choice left back Lief Davis, and is yet to make an appearance this season after suffering an ACL tear in August 2025. </p>
<br>
<h4> <b> Ainsley Maitland-Niles </b> </h4> 
<p> Only at the Hawthorns for 6 months, Ainsley Maitland-Niles played 12 times for the club while on loan from Arsenal. Known for his versatility, Maitland-Niles started most of his 12 games in defensive midfield, but has often been deployed as a right back elsewhere in his career. After returning to Arsenal, further loan deals to Roma and Southampton followed, though neither side wished to make the move permanent. Maitland-Niles left Arsenal on a free transfer in 2023, joining French giants Lyon, where he has become a valuable squad member. </p>

<br>
<h4> <b> Okay Yokuşlu </b> </h4>
<br>
<p> On loan at the Hawthorns for the second half of the 20/21 season, Yokuşlu impressed over his 16 appearances and would later join the club permanently in 2022. The Turk would go on to make 84 further league appearances for the club, cementing himself as a fan favourite and consistent performer in the Championship, winning players’ player of the year for the 22/23 season. Okay would leave the club in 2024 to move back to Turkey with Trabzonspor, where he made just 10 SüperLig appearances last season. </p>
<br>
<h4> <b> Matt Phillips </b> </h4>
<br>
<p> Long time servant Matt Phillips started at right winger, and lasted until the 89th minute of the match. Perhaps remembered best for a long ranged effort against Crystal Palace in his QPR days, Phillips spent 8 seasons at the Hawthorns, eventually leaving in 2024 on a free to Oxford United. Phillips played over 250 games for the club, scoring 31 goals and registering 31 assists, but struggled with injuries towards the end of his stint in the West Midlands. Now 34, since joining Oxford United Phillips has been disappointing and has continued to struggle with injuries. </p>
<br>
<h4> <b> Matheus Pereira </b> </h4>
<br>
<p> Doubtlessly one of the standout performers not just on the day but across the whole season for West Brom, Pereira scored a quickfire double in first half stoppage time to turn the game on its head at Stamford Bridge. Pereira scored 11 times in the 20/21 Premier League season, after his loan deal from the previous year was made permanent. Following the Baggies’ relegation from the Premier League, a public fallout with former manager Valerian Ismael saw the Brazilian depart for Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal, much to the disappointment of fans. Following two years in the Saudi Pro-League, Pereira moved back to his native Brazil, where he now plays for Cruzerio, and even managed to earn a solitary international cap in 2024. </p>
<br>
<h4> <b> Mbaye Diagne </b> </h4> 
<br>
<p> Journeyman striker Mbaye Diagne played 6 months of English football in his career which spans 16 different clubs and 9 different leagues, during a loan deal at West Brom in the second half of the 20/21 season. The Senegalese international scored 3 goals for the Baggies, including a 68th minute strike in the game in question. Overall, the striker impressed enough for West Brom to unsuccessfully attempt to make the deal permanent following relegation. Instead, Diagne played a final season for Galatasaray, before embarking on three consecutive one year stints at Fatih Karagumruk (Turkish Super-Lig), Al-Qadsiah (then second division in Saudi Arabia), Neom (Saudi Pro-League). Diagne now plays for Amed in the Turkish second division, where he continues to be prolific at the age of 34. </p>
<br>
<h4> <b> Branislav Ivanović </b> </h4>
<br>
<p> A Champions League, Europa League, and three-time Premier League winner, the highly decorated Serbian spent just one season at the Hawthorns, making 13 Premier League appearances across a difficult campaign. Ivanović lasted just 13 minutes in this game, replacing the injured Dara O’Shea before needing to be replaced himself with a hamstring problem against his former side. It would prove to be his final appearance for the club as Ivanović left at the end of the season on a free, and subsequently retired at the age of 37. Since retirement, Ivanović has taken a step away from public life, and seems to be focusing on his family. </p>
<br>
<h4> <b> Callum Robinson </b> </h4>
<br>
<p> Another star on the day, the attacking introduction of Robinson for Ivanović saw a formation change and two goals for the forward. The first of these goals won Albion’s goal of the season, a stunning volley which was also nominated for Premier League goal of the month. Robinson struggled over his time at West Brom, ultimately leaving for less than £2m to Cardiff City back in 2022. Robinson has since made over 100 league appearances for the Bluebirds, and is popular amongst their fanbase. Following Cardiff’s Championship relegation in 24/25, he now plays in League 1 where this season he has been left frustrated with his limited gametime. </p>

<br>
<h4> <b> Jake Livermore </b> </h4>
<br>
<p> A man who needs little introduction, Livermore made over 200 league appearances for West Brom over a 6 year stint during which he was named captain. The former England international came on in the 89th minute of the game, a late replacement for Matt Phillips as West Brom looked to shore up their defense. A mainstay at times over his Baggies career, Livermore struggled for gametime in his final seasons at West Brom and wound up leaving on a free transfer in 2023 as West Brom made the playoffs without his presence on the field. The midfielder subsequently signed for a year with Watford, where he appeared 32 times across the campaign, but ended up a free agent once more at the end of the 23/24 season. Despite reports that Livermore wished to continue playing, no new club emerged and Livermore is considered to be retired, despite a lack of official announcement. </p>
